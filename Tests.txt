testRoomLabels:
Curb Room is the first room in the layout. Walkway is the last room in the layout. I test three other rooms as well, some with whitespaces in their names.

testBoardDimensions:
We have 20 rows and 30 columns.

fourDoorDirections:
The Honey Room has a leftwards doorway. The Curb Room has an upwards doorway. The Dart Room has a rightwards doorway. The Honey Room also has a downwards doorway.

testNumberOfDoorways:
There are 11 total doorways, two of which are adjacent to two rooms each.

testRooms:
The locations for a standard room cell, room label cell, room center cell, and room secret passage cell are all for different rooms. The walkway cell is also right next to a room, just to make sure our layout's borders are perfectly understood.

Second row is missing its last column.

testBadRoom:
ClueLayoutBadRoom.csv has a rectangular room of initial "J", which does not exist in the legend.
